# Music-Data-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modelling
Our main objective is to analyze the dataset of songs from Spotify and their YouTube videos. 
We plan to build machine learning models that predict the popularity of a song on YouTube (number of likes) based on various features such as Spotify popularity (number of streams), danceability, energy, key, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration, and other attributes.
We will gather insights into the factors that contribute most to the popularity of songs to help artists create well-received music and corresponding videos.
We are using a public dataset from Kaggle called “Spotify and YouTube” with data collected on February 07, 2023, consisting of over 20,000 records, and 26 variables for each song. 
We will be using Excel, Python, and its libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn to preprocess and analyze the dataset and try to build a machine learning model for prediction. 
Jupyter Notebook is our primary tool for coding and documentation and Tableau will be used to visualize the established insights.
